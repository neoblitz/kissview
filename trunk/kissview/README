What is kissview?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
kissview is an ultrasimple yet powerful webserver log analysis tool. The rationale behind this 
tool is to output very simple statistics gleaned from an HTTP logfile. This tool is nowhere as 
feature-rich as compared to the power of awstats and the like and that is exactly the point behind 
this tool. Thus it is named kissview (Keep it Simple Stupid, Viewer).

Kissview takes in a Apache logfile(ASCII or Gzipped) and produces a static HTML file containing 
visualizations written using Google Visualization APIs. Thats it! Nothing more, Nothing less!


Usage
=-=-=
